📖 **The Rise, Falls, and Patterns of Amazon: A Story in Stock Data**

In the late 1990s, a little-known online bookstore quietly entered the stock market. Two decades later, it became a trillion-dollar juggernaut. This is the story of Amazon's evolution—told not by headlines, but by numbers.

🟢 **Chapter 1: Humble Beginnings, Massive Ambitions**

From its first trading day in 1997, Amazon (AMZN) began a journey that defied traditional business logic. The stock price was low, the profits nonexistent—but the daily trading volume, averaging millions of shares even then, hinted at a company with investor magnetism.

By calculating the total return over time, we uncovered a staggering truth: If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon back then, your stake would be worth hundreds of thousands today. Few companies in modern history have generated that kind of return.

📈 **Chapter 2: Riding the Rollercoaster**

The path to the top wasn't straight—it was wild.

When plotted cumulative returns over time, the line shot upward in waves, not a smooth curve. The dot-com crash in 2000, the financial crisis in 2008, and the COVID collapse in 2020 all left deep craters in the price chart. But each time, AMZN came back stronger.

Volatility wasn’t just an abstract term—it was real and visible. Our analysis of 30-day rolling volatility showed massive spikes during turbulent years, especially in 2008 and March 2020, when fear and uncertainty ruled the markets.

📊 **Chapter 3: The Rhythm of a Giant**

Stock prices may seem chaotic, but Amazon showed patterns.

It is found that April and November often brought strong returns—perhaps aligned with earnings seasons or holiday optimism. Conversely, September consistently underperformed, echoing a known phenomenon on Wall Street.

By analyzing monthly and yearly returns, it can be seen that the company maturing: early years had explosive annual returns, while recent years were steadier, reflecting Amazon’s transition from high-growth startup to global leader.

📉 **Chapter 4: When Things Fell Apart Even giants stumble.**

On certain days, AMZN plunged over 10–15%, revealed by our list of the top single-day losses. These weren’t flukes—they often followed poor earnings, macroeconomic shocks, or regulatory fears.

The maximum drawdown, measuring how far the stock fell from its highest point, reminded of investing’s sobering reality. At its worst, Amazon's stock lost over 90% of its value during the early 2000s. It took years to recover—patience was non-negotiable.

🧠 **Chapter 5: What the Market Really Tells Us We dug deeper.**

The correlation between open and close prices showed that Amazon was generally stable within trading days—big news rarely blindsided the stock mid-day.

Then layered in technical indicators:

The 30-day moving average smoothed the short-term noise.

The 200-day moving average revealed long-term trends and potential buy/sell signals.

Bullish and bearish months gave insights into market psychology—when optimism ruled, and when doubt crept in.

These weren’t just academic metrics. Together, painted a behavioral picture of investors over decades.

🔄 **Chapter 6: Splits, Surges, and Sentiment**

Amazon’s stock splits were inflection points. While a split doesn’t change a company’s value, our analysis showed a fascinating pattern: investor optimism often surged before a split, possibly due to improved affordability and perceived momentum.

Also tracked longest bull runs—periods when AMZN rose day after day without interruption. These runs, sometimes 10+ days long, symbolized market euphoria and investor faith.
